#### Beta versions (Release Candidates) :package:

##### via Google Play

Sign up at [Google Play Beta channel](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.xstations.talk) to get Release Candidates via Google Play.

##### via github

You can also get the Release Candidates at [github releases](https://github.com/xstations/talk-android/releases).

#### Alpha versions

##### via Google Play

To become an alpha tester you have to be signed up for the [Google Play Beta channel](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.xstations.talk) 
and additionally you have to join the [Alpha testing Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/xstations-android-talk-alpha-testing). 
After that you will receive the alpha versions via the Play Store (initially, this might take some minutes after
 signing up). However, in the Play Store the app will still be named "X Stations (Beta)" even if you are an alpha tester, but you will receive the alpha versions.
If a beta was released that is newer than the alpha version, you will get the beta in the alpha channel.

Please make sure to remember that these versions might contain bugs and you don't use them in production.
